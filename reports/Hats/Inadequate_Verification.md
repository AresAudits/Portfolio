## Title: Inadequate Verification of safe Address in _executeModuleTransaction Function Leading to Potential Execution of Malicious Contracts

### severity
 High

### Description

The function _executeModuleTransaction in Helpers.sol accepts an address safe and calls execTransactionFromModule on it. If a malicious user passes an address of a contract that mimics the ISafe interface, they can potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the Helpers contract. This is because the contract does not verify that the safe address is indeed a legitimate ISafe contract.


#### Impact
firstly attacker can execute any malicious code they desire and this vulnerability is particularly `concerning` beacuse as `Palmera` is a multi-safe and multi-chain treasury management platform designed to simplify financial on-chain management with unified `DashBoard` and `Role-Based Access Control`(**Securely manage dashboard access with specific roles and permissions, supporting flexible governance structures and operational efficiency.) and `Real-Time Notifications`(Provides immediate updates on crucial activities and transactions via native OS notifications and PUSH protocol integration, ensuring users are always informed of important `events`.) the vulnerable function i.e `_executeModuleTransaction()` is used in critical functions like `addOwnerWithThreshold` and `removeOwner`. These functions are essential for managing ownership and roles within the DAO or organization.

`Example - Fake Removal of Owners`: Imagine a malicious actor exploiting this vulnerability. They could deploy a malicious contract that mimics the `execTransactionFromModule` function and This contract could emit an event like `emit RemovedOwner(owner);`, tricking the `Palmera Dashboard`(as the dashboard depends on the `events` ) into displaying that the owner has been removed or role is updated. However, in reality, the role is not retained or the owner is not removed , maintaining their control and access.

`Example - Fake Addition of Owners`: Similarly, the attacker could use the `addOwnerWithThreshold` function with a malicious contract to emit `emit AddedOwner(owner);` events. This could add unauthorized owners to the DAO, but emiting the actual or legit owner undermining the governance by allowing the malicious actor to add themselves or their accomplices as owners .

### Proof Of Concept

Attack Scenario

1. Malicious Contract Creation: An attacker creates a contract that implements the ISafe interface, specifically the execTransactionFromModule function.
2. Passing Malicious Contract: The attacker passes the address of this malicious contract to the _executeModuleTransaction function.
3. Execution of Malicious Code: When _executeModuleTransaction calls execTransactionFromModule on the malicious contract, the attacker's code is executed, potentially leading to unauthorized transactions or other malicious actions.

```
/// @dev refactoring of execution of Tx with the privilege of the Module Palmera Labs, and avoid repeat code
    /// @param safe Safe Address to execute Tx
    /// @param data Data to execute Tx
    function _executeModuleTransaction(address safe, bytes memory data)
        internal
        nonReentrant
    {
        ISafe targetSafe = ISafe(safe);
        bool result = targetSafe.execTransactionFromModule(//@audit potential bypass
            safe, uint256(0), data, Enum.Operation.Call
        );
        if (!result) revert Errors.TxExecutionModuleFailed();
    }
```
